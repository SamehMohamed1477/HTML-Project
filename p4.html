			<h1>Introduction to Language Java Script</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>JavaScript is a programming language that was originally designed to add effects and interactions to web pages. Interactions mean everything that is done or performed at the browser level without the need to reload the page.</li><br>
				<li>Hide or show a specific HTML element when clicking on another element.</li><br>
				<li>Create and move sliders.</li><br>
				<li>Perform AJAX operations.</li><br>
				<li>Data validation in Forms or Form Validation.</li><br>
				<li>Such interactions are felt on a daily basis as we interact with major platforms and sites such as Google and Facebook. When the first person proposes a word or a sentence when we write a letter or two for him, he does this via JavaScript, and when we go down to Facebook news tape and new material is added to the tape automatically whenever we go down, he uses javascript to do this, and he measured what you find and see every day On the sites you visit.</li><br>
			</ul>

			<h2>Uses of the Java Script programming language</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Building mobile applications as well as desktop applications through modern technologies such as React Native, Ionic and Electron.</li><br>
				<li>Developing games that run inside the browser. The games that are now provided by Facebook, for example, on its website known as Instant Games, are games based on JavaScript. The dinosaur game as well, which we play although we do not like it on the Chrome browser when the Internet connection is disconnected, is also dependent on this language.</li><br>
				<li>Backend Systems Development Since Node.js was first announced in 2009, in my view it served as the third birth certificate for JavaScript after its first birthday in 1995 by Brendan Eich and his second birth in 2004 with support for Ajax technology.</li><br>

					<td>Java is a Complied language, where the source code is converted to the machine language, and the program code is executed

					Example : javac myClass.java <br>
							  java myClass</td>
					<td>Python is an interpreted language which means that its code is interpreted and executed directly.

					Example : python myClasss.py</td>
