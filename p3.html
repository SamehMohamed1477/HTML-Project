			<h1>Introduction to Language C++</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>It is one of the high-level programming languages ​​of general use, was created and developed during the seventies of the twentieth century by Dennis Ritchie, and Thompson through Bell Labs was originally designed to interfere with the development of the work Unix operating systems.</li><br>
				<li>It has gained wide popularity from that time until now, due to its popularity with most computer programmers and its many and varied uses.</li><br>
				<li>The C programming language is the mother tongue of many modern programming languages ​​such as c ++
 				The C programming language is also a very ideal language, and it is very efficient for writing many firmware (FireWare) and for writing programs and mobile (Portable).</li><br>
 				<li>It is also a multi-purpose, command-oriented language that helps support structured programming, self-recall, and variable programmatic pronunciation. The design of C programming has provided many precise assignment combinations for ideal machine instructions.</li><br>
 				<li>It is designed to be used permanently in applications that were previously programmed in the assembly language: much like a software application for computers, operating systems, and embedded systems.</li><br>
			</ul>

			<h2>Uses of Programming Language C++</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>It is used in Al programming, which is known as programming artificial intelligence, and building algorithms.</li><br>
				<li>It is used in programming video games, such as Dyote, Far Cry, and Call Of.</li><br>
				<li>It is used in programming, designing blockchain applications, and numeric currencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.</li><br>
				<li>Mac and Windows programming.</li><br>
				<li>It is used in the development of Google search engine and other web applications.</li><br>
				<li>Used in the design and development of computer applications such as Adobe.</li><br>
				<li>Used in the development of other programming languages ​​as Java.</li><br>
				<li>Mobile application programming</li><br>
				<li>Used in programming (IPhone) applications.</li><br>
